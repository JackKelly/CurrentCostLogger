Reads data from a Current Cost EnviR display via USB port to a Linux machine and logs the data to a file.

Based on Paul Mutton's excellent Perl script and tutorial: http://www.jibble.org/currentcost/
with modifications from Jamie Bennett: http://www.linuxuk.org/2008/12/currentcost-and-ubuntu/


----------------
  Dependencies 
================
This module requires the Device::SerialPort Perl module.  Install this using Perl's package manager:
At the Linux command line, type:
    sudo perl -MCPAN -e shell
And then type:
    install Device::SerialPort


---------------
  Data format
===============
The data format of the data.txt file is:
UNIX  TIME	WATTS	DD/MM/YEAR HH:MM:SS

The time and date is taken from the local machine, not the Current
Cost (although the time is extracted from the Current Cost's output so
it would be easy to use the time from the Current Cost rather than
from the local Linux machine.)


-----------------------------------
  To import into Open Office Calc
===================================
On the import, select “separated by tabs” and “detect special numbers”
